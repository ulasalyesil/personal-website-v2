            . Since Genesis is trying to tell the story of a new beginning, a
            creation of a new world, the adaptation of human kind to change; it
            still acknowledges that humans and their beliefs will always effect
            the technology, change and art. So to tell this story even outside
            of the show, a 7 time show for the creation of a new world with the
            concept of 7 days of creation.
